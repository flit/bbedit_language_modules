To install, quit BBEdit and place the module Matlab.bblm in
/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
or
~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
depending on where your BBEdit Application Support folder is located. Remove any previous versions of the Matlab plug-in and restart BBEdit. The same instructions apply equally to TextWrangler, but install in the TextWrangler/Language Modules/ folder in Applicaton Support. 

You may have to remove the .m suffix mapping for Objective-C to get the module to work properly.

This version was built with Xcode as a bundle containing a universal binary, and requires BBEdit 8.0 or higher or TextWrangler 2.0 or higher.

New in version 2.3:
Added support for new keywords 'parfor', 'classdef', 'events', 'properties', 'methods'. 

New in version 2.2:
Support for block comments. In recent versions of MATLAB, a block comment is started with '%{' and ended with '%}'. The delimiters must be placed on blank lines, or else they behave as ordinary line comments. Block comments may be nested.

New in version 2.1:
Built as a universal binary. No other changes.

New in version 2.0:
Continuation characters '...' are colored the same as keywords, and all text following '...' is colored the same as comments to the end of the line.

System commands that follow an '!' are now colored. This color may be set using the 'Processing Instructions' button in the 'Text Colors' preference panel in BBEdit.

The color of uncompleted character strings can be set using the 'Image' button in the 'Text Colors' preference panel.

Also, keywords that are used as members of structures are now not colored as keywords.Ê For example a structure might have a member called 'function'. It would be normal for references to this member such as my_struct.function to not have any coloration on the word 'function'. Also, when 'end' is used as an index to an array such as my_array(1:end) it will now not be colored. In fact, keywords will only be colored if they appear in their proper context as matlab flow control statements.

The function popup menu will now position the cursor at the start of any comments that precede the start of the function definition.

Newer versions of matlab allow functions to be nested if they are terminated by 'end' statements. The function popup menu indents nested function names accordingly.
